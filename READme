1. mace_ml_model.pkl is trained model on magicdataset.csv
2. scaler.pkl is a scaler model
    A scaler is a preprocessing tool used to normalize or standardize feature values so that all input features are on the same scale.
In our case, we used StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the MAGIC dataset's features before training the model.
